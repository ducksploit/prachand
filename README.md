# Prachand

A C2(Command and Control) framework with which we can handle different machines remotely.
It uses rust in implant and python in the server side
Currently it can be used to control only windows os.


The usage is quite simple as we just need to start the main script and we have all options under one shell. enter 'help' command in the prachand shell and it will show all the commands related to generating implant and interacting with a session.

When you are interacting with a session, you just need to enter the command 'exit' or 'background' and the session will be preserved and you can use the other features of the framework or interact wit a different session

Currently as on 7th April 2023, it bypass almost all AVs on virustotal
